<h2>What is space?</h2>
<p>
The concept of space can be regarded as the most central concept of human geography as a science. It is striking, however, that geographers have paid relatively little attention to the concept of space. The term (geographical) 'space' is used frequently and most thoughtlessly, always referring directly or indirectly to terrestrial space, the surface of the earth in all its landscape forms. However, if you analyze the history of the concept, you will discover that many different factors have had a meaning for its characteristics and functions in a way that is difficult to trace. Space is a concept that exists both in non-scientific thinking and is also used in many sciences. In geography we make a distinction between absolute and relative space.
